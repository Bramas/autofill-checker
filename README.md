# autofill-checker

Chrome extension to check what was autofilled by chrome

The goal is to avoid sending too much information, like it has been shown here [https://github.com/anttiviljami/browser-autofill-phishing](https://github.com/anttiviljami/browser-autofill-phishing)

# This is not a good protection

There are a lots  of way to bypass this extension and steal you're data anyway. The only way to avoid this is to don't use autofill.
